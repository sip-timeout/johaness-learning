# Tic Tac Toe

Write a program that checks which player has won a given Tic Tac Toe game.
The input is a 3*3 matrix that looks like this (as an example):

        [[1, 2, 0],
        [2, 1, 0],
        [2, 1, 1]]
        
you should return which player is the winner (1 or 2).
if it is a tie, the program will identify it.
